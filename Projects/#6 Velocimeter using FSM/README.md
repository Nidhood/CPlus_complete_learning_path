## Project: üöÄ Speedometer with Arduino Mega 2560 üöó

This project implements a speedometer using an Arduino Mega 2560, a Hall sensor, and a TFT LCD screen. The project is written in C language and uses the Arduino IDE.

### Components

- Arduino Mega 2560 üõ†Ô∏è
- Hall Sensor üîç
- TFT LCD Screen üñ•Ô∏è
- DC Power Supply of 5.43 V üîå

### Connection Scheme

The detailed scheme of the connections can be found in the attached file [connection_scheme.pdf](connection_scheme.pdf).

### Libraries

The following libraries are used for the project to function properly:

- Adafruit_GFX_Library üìö
- Adafruit_TFTLCD_Library üìö
- Adafruit_TouchScreen üìö

### File Structure

- **app/Speedometer/Speedometer.ino**: Main source code of the project.
- **libraries/Adafruit_GFX_Library/**: Folder containing the Adafruit GFX library.
- **libraries/Adafruit_TFTLCD_Library/**: Folder containing the Adafruit TFTLCD library.
- **libraries/Adafruit_TouchScreen/**: Folder containing the Adafruit TouchScreen library.
- **libraries/motionDataCalculator/**: Folder containing the motionDataCalculator.
- **photos/**: Optional folder for storing images related to the project.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Open a terminal or command line.
    - Execute the following command to clone the repository:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/Nidhood/C_complete_learning_path
      ```

2. **Download and Install the Arduino IDE:**
    - If you haven't installed the Arduino IDE yet, download it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) üì•.
    - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. **Open the Arduino IDE:**
    - Open the Arduino IDE you just installed.

4. **Install Required Libraries:**
    - Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
    - In the search box, enter the name of each library and click "Install" for the following libraries:
        - Adafruit GFX Library
        - Adafruit TFTLCD Library
        - Adafruit TouchScreen
        - motionDataCalculator

5. **Upload the Code to the Arduino:**
    - Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and open the `app/main.c` file with the Arduino IDE.
    - Make sure to select the correct board and serial port in `Tools > Board` and `Tools > Port`.
    - Click the verification button (‚úì) to verify the code.
    - Once verified without errors, click the upload button (‚û°Ô∏è) to upload the code to the Arduino Mega 2560.

6. **Assemble the Device:**
    - Refer to the `connection_scheme.pdf` file to make the physical connections between the Arduino Mega 2560, the Hall sensor, and the TFT LCD screen.

7. **Power On the Arduino:**
    - Once all connections are made, connect the Arduino Mega 2560 to your computer via USB or external power, as needed.

8. **Test the Functionality:**
    - Verify that the speedometer works correctly by observing the TFT LCD screen to see the speed measured by the Hall sensor.

By following these steps, you should be able to clone the repository, install the necessary libraries, upload the code to the Arduino, and have the project working on your device. Hope this helps! üéâ

### Functionality

The speedometer measures the vehicle's speed using the Hall sensor. This sensor generates a pulse each time a magnet passes in front of it. The Arduino Mega 2560 counts the number of pulses generated by the Hall sensor in one second and calculates the vehicle's speed accordingly. The speed is displayed on the TFT LCD screen.

### Proposed Enhancements

- Integration of a button to allow the user to switch between different speed units (km/h, mph, etc.). üõ†Ô∏è
- Implementation of an alarm that activates when the vehicle exceeds a certain speed. üö®
